## 🚀 Mission Brief
Traditional coding courses are boring. ShadowGame changes the game by replacing video lectures with **interactive missions**:
- **The Cargo Hold**: Learn Rust variables & ownership.
- **Kernel Panic**: Write a basic process scheduler.
- **Data Heist**: optimize SQL queries against a live rival.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Core**: Next.js 15, TypeScript
- **Style**: Tailwind CSS v4, Framer Motion, GSAP
- **Engine**: Monaco Editor (VS Code in browser)
- **Backend**: PostgreSQL, Prisma, NextAuth.js
- **Structure**: Modular Component Architecture (`ui`, `game`, `providers`)
